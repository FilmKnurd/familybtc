# What the heck did I just get?

This is probably a weird and super nerdy gift, but you are basically holding in your hands a brick of digital gold (Bitcoin or BTC). Like gold, anyone who has this cold storage wallet has the money and can spend it, so keep it hidden in a safe.

The smallest unit of BTC is called a Satoshi or sat, named after the psuedonym of the creator of Bitcoin. To see how many sats you have and the value of those sats in dollars, download the [Ballet app](https://www.ballet.com/app/) and scan the QR code on the face of the wallet.

## Stacking Sats

You will want to stack sats over time, and the easiest way to do that is to 
1. Create an account at an exchange (my reccomendations below)
2. setup recurring buys
3. Setup auto withdrawls into this wallet. 
Have fun watching your pile of gold grow :smile:
